# Using data inputed by hand to create a dataframe to use with Control Charts

# NOTE: If you import an excel spreadsheet you can use the following line to eliminate
# columns you don't want to use
# testData = test[, -c(1,5)] <---- the -c(1,5) tells R not to use columns 1 & 5

# Sec 6.3, number 18 from the book. 
# part a.
# Importing the dataset from the data_set folder. Make sure to add the
# library(readxl) at the top of the code.
ex06_0318 <- read_excel("/Users/ccoussa717/Desktop/College Classes/National University/CSC220_AppliedStats/R_Code/data_sets/EXCEL/Chapter06/exer06-0318.xls")

# This line takes the dataset and removes the first column from being used.
ex06_0318Corrected = ex06_0318[, -c(1)]

qcc(ex06_0318Corrected, type = "R")
# In the R Chart there are no out-of-control signals.

# part b
qcc(ex06_0318Corrected)
# Yes, there are three out-of-control signals in this dataset.

###### Calculating x-bar (mean of the mean) and R-bar (mean of the range) ######
# This line gets the means for all the rows of data
rowMeans(ex06_0318Corrected)
# This row calculates the mean of the means, or x-bar (CENTERLINE)
mean(rowMeans(ex06_0318Corrected)) # <---- 12.9888

# This line gets the range of the dataset
apply(ex06_0318Corrected, 1, max) - apply(ex06_0318Corrected, 1, min)
# This line gets the mean of the range, or R-bar (CENTERLINE)
mean(apply(ex06_0318Corrected, 1, max) - apply(ex06_0318Corrected, 1, min)) # <--- 0.102

###### Creating Venn Diagrams ######
# In order to create a Venn diagram you need to install the gplots package and
# activate the library at the top.
# a & b represent sets of 3 coin flips
a = c("HHH", "HTT", "THT", "TTT", "HHT")
b = c("THH", "HTT", "HHT", "TTT", "TTH")
# Creates a list from variables a & b
v.list = list(a, b)
# Create the venn diabram from the list of data
venn(v.list)

###### Creating random Normally Distributed data ######
# Each time you run the rnorm command it will create a new set of random numbers
# so that the sd and mean will be different.
# If you add the set.see(1) command it will always generate the same numbers
set.seed(1)
normDis = rnorm(1000, mean = 100, sd = 15)
mean(normDis) # <---- Very close to 100 at 99.82528
sd(normDis) # <---- Very close to 15 at 15.52374
plot(normDis)
#### Visualizing the distribution of the data
# Histogram of normDis dataset, shows the distribution of the dataset
hist(normDis, probability = TRUE)
# Q-Q plot of the dataset, shows how close to Normally Distributed your data is.
qqnorm(normDis)

###### Wednesday Practice Part 1 ######

# Bring in e11.7 package from DevFarn2
data(e11.7)
# Shows the data type and the data itself
str(e11.7)
# Make a histogram and boxplot for x variable
hist(e11.7$x, main = "x varible from e11.7 Dataset", col = "red", breaks = 10)
boxplot(e11.7$x, main = "Boxplot for e11.7 Dataset", col = "blue", horizontal = TRUE)

# Create a linear regression model Y-hat = mx + b
myDataModel = lm(y ~ x, data = e11.7)
# Obtain the coefficients for the linear model Y-hat = mx + b
summary(myDataModel)$coefficients # Y-hat = -0.29756x + 27.18294
# Create a new plot with x and y, REMEBER to use the name of the dataset,
# not the linear model name!
plot(e11.7$x, e11.7$y, xlab = "x_Data", ylab = "y_Data", main = "Linear Regression Model", col = "green")
abline(myDataModel, col = 258, lwd = 2, lty =4)
# What is the coefficiant when x = 25, given Y-hat = -0.29756x + 27.18294?
# This is called the Predicted y, meaning what is Y-hat.
predict(myDataModel, data.frame(x = 25)) # Y-hat = 19.74391
# To get the RESIDUAL, subtrat y-hat from y
myDataModelY_hat = 27.18294 - 19.74391
print(myDataModelY_hat) # Residual = 7.43903

###### Part 2 ######
# Bring in the data from DevFarn2 e1.12, multiple x variables
data(e11.12)
str(e11.12)

# Preform a Multiple Linear Regression using Strength as y
plot(e11.12$Force, e11.12$Time, main = "Data is Force vs Time", xlab = "Forece", ylab = "Time", col = "green")
myMultipleData = lm(Strength ~ Force + Power + Temperature + Time, data = e11.12)
summary(myMultipleData)$coefficients # Y-hat = -37.477 + 0.212x1 + 0.498x2 + 0.129x3 + 0.258x4
# Obtain Y-hat for Force = 35, Power = 75, Temperature = 200, and Time = 20
predict(myMultipleData, data.frame(Force = 35, Power = 75, Temperature = 200, Time = 20)) # Y-hat = 38.40667
# Getting the Residual y - Y-hat
residual_myMultipleData = -37.477 - 38.40667
print(residual_myMultipleData) # Residual = -75.88

###### Create a Q-Q Plot for one variable ######
data(e2.18)
qqnorm(e2.18$X1)
qqline(e2.18$X1, col = "red")


###### Obtaining the Confidence Interval using T-test ######
data(e7.3)
str(e7.3)
boxplot(e7.3, horizontal = TRUE, xlab = "voltage")
mean(e7.3)
sd(e7.3)
# Gets Confidence Interval using a default confidence level of 95%
t.test(e7.3)
# Gets Confidence Interval using 80% as the level. By changing the conf.level parameter
# you can manipulate the confinence interval.
t.test(e7.3, conf.level = .8)
```
