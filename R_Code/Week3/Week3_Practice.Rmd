###### Week 3 Session 1 ######
library(qcc)
library(DevFarn2)
library(readxl)


# Importing a data frame from the DevFarn2 examples
data(e2.16)
# Summary of the e2.16 data frame (descriptive analysis of the data, range is max - min)
summary(e2.16)

# View the data frame in a separate window
# View(e2.16)

boxplot(e2.16, main = "Example", col = "red", horizontal = TRUE)
# Boxplot shows 3 possible outliers at the bottom of the plot, under 20.

###### Quantile-Quantile Plots (qq plot) ######
# If you have a Normal Distribution of variables, take the qq plot of the data it
# is a straight line. 2 variable dataset
data(e2.18) 
qqnorm(e2.18$X1) # the $x1 means that you are going into the e2.18 dataset and getting
# the data for for the x1 variable

###### Creating a data frame with Normal Distrubution using rnorm() ######
dataW3s1  = rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 20)
plot(dataW3s1, main = "Normal Distribution", col = "blue")
# Given that the data frame dataW2s1 has Normal Distribution, the qq plot should be straight
qqnorm(dataW3s1)

###### Working with data of three variables (x1, x2, and y)
data(e3.15)
summary(e3.15)
dim(e3.15)
# Create a scatter matrix for all three data sets of the data frame
# Use labels to change the labels of the plots
pairs(e3.15, labels = c("Iron", "Aluminum", "Gold"), col = "gold", pch = 20)

data("Bears")
# str shows internal structure of the dataset, alternative to summary
str(Bears)

# Create a linear model from the Bears dataframe using 2 variables
plot(Bears$Weight, Bears$Age, main = "Bear Data", xlab = "ID", ylab = "Age",
     col = "black")
# REMEBER: When you created a linear model you have to put your y variable first!
# So reverse the order from your plot in order for the linear line to be correct.
lmBears = lm(Bears$Age ~ Bears$Weight, data = Bears)
summary(lmBears)
# Yhat = 0.219x + 2.613
abline(lmBears, col = "red")
legend(x = 175, y=NULL, legend = "Yhat = 0.219x + 2.613", col = "black", bg = "white")

###### Week 3 Day 6 ######

# Working with data imprted from an Excel file

# Bringing in the data from the excel file requires the redxl library and the file path
ex01_01 <- read_excel("/Users/ccoussa717/Desktop/College Classes/National University/CSC220_AppliedStats/R_Code/data_sets/EXCEL/Chapter01/ex01-01.xls")
hist(ex01_01$Percent_expenditures, main = "Example Data From Chapter One", breaks = 20, col = "red")
boxplot(ex01_01, main = "Boxplot of Example Data", col = "blue")
sd(ex01_01$Percent_expenditures) # Standard Deviation is 12.7411
mean(ex01_01$Percent_expenditures) # Mean is 10.89167
var(ex01_01$Percent_expenditures) # Variance is 162.3357

ex01_04 <- read_excel("/Users/ccoussa717/Desktop/College Classes/National University/CSC220_AppliedStats/R_Code/data_sets/EXCEL/Chapter01/ex01-04.xls")
linearModelEx04 = lm(ex01_04$Luminance ~ ex01_04$Time, data = ex01_04)
plot(ex01_04, main = "New Example Data")
summary(linearModelEx04) # Yhat = -8.388x + 22443.468
abline(linearModelEx04, col = "green")
