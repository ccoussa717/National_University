###### R Code Practice: Week 1 Monday ######

# Get working directory
getwd()

# Simple math operations
4 / 2
log(12)
sqrt(121)
pi
sin(pi/2)
log(1)
(3 * 9) / (2 * 4)

# assigning variables with "=" or "<-"
x <- 5 + 9 #you need to exicute this line to load the var into RAM, then you can use the var
chris = (5 + 9 + 10 - 56) / 32
x
y = 45
z = x + y
print(z)
myNumber = z
rm (myNumber)

# Putting a "?" in front of a function and run it, you will get a help menu
?print()

# Removing variables from memory
rm(chris)
rm(n)

# Generate a sequence of numbers from and to are the range and by is the width between the numbers, a vector is created
chris = seq(from = 3, to = 20, by =4)
print(chris)


###### Creating a Histogram: Week 1 Wednesday ######

# Normal Distribution in R - generate some dummy variables
dummy_data = rnorm(200, 5, 2)
# Generate a Histogram
hist(dummy_data, main = "Normal Distribution", breaks = 10, col = "red", xlab  = "myData", ylab = "testFreq")

?rnorm
# Set the seed to generate the same numbers each time the code runs
set.seed(30)
rnorm(20, 5, 2)
?set.seed

# Creating a vector from set data points, the c stands for "combine"
data = c(3, 5, 6, 20, 25, 34, 58, 65)
print(data)
#Create a plot
plot(data, col = "#B8472F", main = "My Data plot", xlab = "xIndex", ylab = "yData", pch = 2)

# Calculates the Standard Deviation of the data vector
mySd = sd(data)
myVarience = mySd^2
print(mySd)
print(myVarience)
