###### Question 13 ######
# Part a
# Setting the seed ensures R generates the same random numbers
set.seed(10)
# generating 50 random numbers
normDis1 = rnorm(50, mean = 1.55)
str(normDis1)
# Q-Q plot, and Q-Q line
qqnorm(normDis1)
qqline(normDis1)

# Part b
# Mean with 75% Confidence Interval for normDis1
t.test(normDis1, conf.level = .75)

# Part c
# R chart and x-bar chart
x1Final = c(59.664, 59.661, 59.679, 59.665, 59.667, 59.673, 59.676,
