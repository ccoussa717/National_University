# Importing Data_sets, click on the "Import Dataset" in the window to the right. It will
# download the needed packages and you can search for the file you want to import.
# It will show up in the RStudio enviornment as a seperate file.

# After you install qcc, you can install the DevFarn2 file you downloaded form Bb
# Go to install package and switch from package repo to archive, and install
# from there.

###### Example for Linear Model ######
x = c(.18, .20, .21, .21, .21, .22, .23, .23, .24, .24, .25, .28, .30, .37)
y = c(.46, .70, .41, .45, .55, .44, .24, .47, .22, .80, .88, .70, .72, .75)
mean(x)
mean(y)

plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot Example", xlab = "Hydrogen Content",
      ylab = "Gas Porosity", pch = 9, col = "red")
scatter.smooth(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot Example", xlab = "Hydrogen Content",
      ylab = "Gas Porosity", pch = 9, col = "red")

sum(x)
sum(y)
sum(x^2)
sum(y^2)

###### Method for finding Correlation Coefficient (R^2) ######
cor(x, y)

###### Building a Linear Model for the Data ######
# Converting 2 vectors to a dataframe
dataExample = data.frame(x, y)

# Build a model for linear regression on full dataframe
# y = mx + b ----> b is y intercept
linearModel = lm(y ~ x, data = dataExample)
plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot Example", xlab = "Hydrogen Content",
      ylab = "Gas Porosity", pch = 3, col = "red")

# abline fits the linear line for the dataframe in the scatter plot
abline(linearModel, col = "red")
summary(linearModel)
# From the table below y = mx + b is
# y = 1.89x + 0.10
